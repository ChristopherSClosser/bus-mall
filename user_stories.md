# User stories:

### For market research

As a market researcher, I need to know which products out of a group are the most likely to be purchased. Also if it is chosen, how many times was the item shown?

### Developer

As a developer, I need to write a program that will take a group of items, show them to a user (3 at a time), keep track of those items shown, and once a user selects 25 items, keep a log and show the user the results. Two of the same items must not appear on the same page, and an item can only show after three pages.

### Focus group member

As a focus group member, I want to help with market research by selecting items that are appealing to me. _ This process needs to be painless and enjoyable. _
